## Overview
This UX/UI portfolio was strategically built using an AI orchestration workflow. The project was reverse-engineered to target UX recruiters in NYC and NJ.

## Orchestration Log
During development, the AI initially suggested using a heavy frontend framework. I rejected this and chose a lightweight HTML/CSS structure to prioritize clarity, performance, and fast GitHub Pages deployment.

## 200 Word Reflection
For this assignment, I didn't just ask the AI to "build me a website" and hope it worked. Instead, I used a "Spect-Driven" plan. Usually when you ask AI to do a big project, it starts off strong but then it gets confused and starts making weird mistakes. I fixed that by making a "Rule Book" (the Specs) before I even started coding.
I set uup a project_management folder to keep everything organized into small chores called "Sprints." This made the AI act like a worker while I acted like the boss. By doing only one small thing at a time, like fixing colors, I kept the AI from drifting off into a mess. It felt like a video game where I have save points. If something went wrong, I could just go back to my last save and try again. This taught me that being good with AI isn't about the code as much as it is about having a solid plan.
