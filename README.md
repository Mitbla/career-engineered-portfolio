# Career Engineered Portfolio

## Live Site
(To be added after GitHub Pages deployment)

## Overview
This UX/UI portfolio was strategically built using an AI orchestration workflow. The project was reverse-engineered to target UX recruiters in NYC and NJ.

## Orchestration Log
During development, the AI initially suggested using a heavy frontend framework. I rejected this and chose a lightweight HTML/CSS structure to prioritize clarity, performance, and fast GitHub Pages deployment.
